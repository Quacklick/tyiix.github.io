        <p>Pets are very important for helping you survive. As a new player,
             one of your main goals should be getting a pet with the right abilities.
              Everything pet-related is done at the <b>Pet Yard</b>. You can access the Pet
               Yard portals in the Nexus or your Vault.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2 id="pet_rarity">Pet Rarity</h2>
        <p>Pets have 5 levels of rarity:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Common (Max Ability Level Cap: 30)</li>
            <li>Uncommon (Max Ability Level Cap: 50)</li>
            <li>Rare (Max Ability Level Cap: 70)</li>
            <li>Legendary (Max Ability Level Cap: 90)</li>
            <li>Divine (Max Ability Level Cap: 100)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At Uncommon, you unlock the second ability. At Legendary, you unlock the third ability.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>


        <h2 id="pet_eggs">Pet Eggs</h2>
        <p>Hatching pet eggs in the Pet Yard is how you obtain pets. The most common way
             for them to drop is from Gods in the Godlands of the Realm, Dungeon Bosses, and
             Event Bosses. Pet Eggs drop in the form of a unique loot bag, resembling an egg basket.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>Hatching <b>Rare/Legendary</b> pet eggs will have the <b>second</b> and <b>third ability levels</b> be <b>randomized</b>.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>


        <h1 id="pet_abilities">Pet Abilities</h1>
        <p>The two most important abilities to have on any pet is <b>Heal</b> and <b>Magic Heal</b>. The other abilities don't need to be as prioritized.</p>
        <h2>Optimal Ability Combination</h2>
        <br><br>
        <!-- two tables in table to format things -->
        <table class="invis1">
            <td>
              <table class="no_hd_t" style="width: 100%;">
                 <td class="border_nhdt">1. Heal</td>
                 </tr>
                 <td class="border_nhdt">2. Magic Heal</td>
                 </tr>
                 <td>3. Electric</td>
                 </tr>
               </table>
            </td>
            <td>
              <p>OR</p>
            </td>
            <td>
               <table class="no_hd_t" style="width: 100%;">
                 <td class="border_nhdt">1. Magic Heal</td>
                 </tr>
                 <td class="border_nhdt">2. Heal</td>
                 </tr>
                 <td>3. Electric</td>
                 </tr>
               </table>
            </td>
               
           </table>
        <p>The 'perfect' combination that most people prefer is Heal/Magic Heal/Electric, or Magic Heal/Heal/Electric.
          <br>
          You don't need to worry about getting Electric as a third ability until you are close to getting a Legendary pet
           (Having a Rare pet with H/MH or MH/H)
        </p>

        <h2>I do not have a Pet with Heal and Magic Heal</h2>
        <p>If you do not have a pet with both abilities, then use a pet that has at least Heal or Magic Heal as
           the first ability and use it as your main pet for now until you hatch a pet with both as the first two abilities.</p>
       <div class="divider"></div>


        <h2 id="feeding">Feeding Pets</h2>
        <p>Feeding a pet costs Fame or Gold. The amount it costs depends on the rarity of the pet. 
          Items have a Feed Power value which determines how much it will level up the pet.</p>
        <p>It is important to find a <b>good ratio of Feed Power</b> to Fame to feed your pet. 
          You will run out of Fame quickly by feeding too many low Feed Power items to your pet.</p>
        <p>Only feed <b>spare UTs</b> you have. For example, it would be better to keep one Doom Bow instead of feeding it to use on your Archer or Huntress.</p>
        <h3>Recommended FP values for Pet Rarities:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Common (200-300+)</li>
            <li>Uncommon (300-500+)</li>
            <li>Rare (500-650+)</li>
            <li>Legendary (700-900+)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <div class="divider"></div>


        <h1 id="fusing">Fusing Pets</h1>
        <p>Fusing pets is the mechanic used to evolve a selected pet to the next rarity,
         while the fodder pet gets deleted in the process.</p>
        <h2>How Fusing Pets Work</h2>
        <p>Fusing pets is pretty simple, but there are some things you need to know:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Only fuse pets when their first ability is maxed</b> (to ensure a MAXED fusion)</li>
            <li>The <b>first pet selected</b> will <b>be kept after fusion with their abilities</b>, the second pet selected <b>will be lost</b></li>
            <li>Pet levels average out after fusion</li>
            <li>You can only fuse pets with the same rarity</li>
            <li>You can only fuse pets with the same family (This is not a problem as you can switch pet families)</li>
            <li>You can only fuse pets if your pet yard is one rarity higher (Ex: You need an Uncommon Pet Yard to fuse 2 Common Pets)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="how_to_fuse">How to Fuse Pets</h2>
        <p>Go to the <b>Pet Yard</b> and go to where the <b>Pet Yard Caretaker NPC</b> is.
           Two buttons at the bottom right should show up. Click on <b>Pets</b> and a UI window should appear.</p>
        <!-- pet yard caretaker img-->
        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <img width=70px; class="iborder" src="https://i.imgur.com/XcyYm1z.png">
          <p>This is what the Yard Caretaker looks like</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <!-- pet fuse img -->
        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <img width=500px; class="iborder" src="https://i.imgur.com/UMDj5hK.png">
        </div>

        <h3>How to work the Pet UI Window:</h3>
        <p>Select a Pet from the left and you can do one of the two options: Feed and Fuse.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Feeding:</b> It will show all the items you have in your inventory and backpack.
               Select the items you want to feed by clicking on them and then click on either the gold or fame button
                to feed your pet <b>(I recommend feeding your pet with fame)</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Fusing:</b> It will show all the pets you have that are the same rarity and family as the first selected pet.
               Select one pet to fuse, and click either button to fuse your pet.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="when_to_fuse">When should I Fuse?</h2>
        <p><b>Never</b> fuse if the first ability of both pets are <b>not maxed</b>.</p>
        <p>The reason why for the above is because a fusion less than MAXED will result in the evolved pet's <b>max ability
           level cap being lower</b> than it should be. If that pet was Rare, it will <b>never</b> be able to have its abilities hit level 70.
        </p>
        <p>It is better to max the levels of the first two abilities on both pets because it is more efficient
           and your first two abilities are the most important (being Heal/Magic Heal on your main pet)</p>

        <h2 id="pet_family_skins">How to Change Pet Family/Skins:</h2>
        <p>Go to the <b>Pet Yard</b> and go to where the <b>Pet Console</b> is. A button should appear at the bottom right.
           Click on <b>Wardrobe</b> and a UI window should appear.</p>
        <!-- pet console img-->
        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <img width=70px; class="iborder" src="https://i.imgur.com/o7AH7Ef.png">

        <h3>How to work the Wardrobe Window:</h3>
        <p>The Collection shows all of the Pet Skins you have obtained (either by fusing or using a certain skin unlocker item).
           The pet at the top left is the pet <b>currently following you by default</b>, but you can click on your pet to change it
            <b>(it will change what pet is following you actively however)</b>.</p>
        <p>Click on a skin in the Collection and there will be two purchase options at the bottom left to confirm changing the skin/family.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It costs <b>100 gold/1000 fame</b> to change your pet skin and the pet family.</li>
          <li>It costs <b>20 gold/200 fame</b> to change your pet skin that is in the same family</li>
        </ul>
